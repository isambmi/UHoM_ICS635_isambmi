[Jupyter notebook](assignment1_ics635.ipynb) containing code, figures, rational and reasoning in assignment 1 comparing the performance of three machine learning models – K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) – using the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn. Different values for key hyperparameters were also tested for each model to explore the impact on model performance. Notebook has been run prior to commit, displaying all figures, with all models trained.
